## Common Causes of Water Damage in Greenville Homes

Understanding the common causes of water damage can help residents take preventive measures. In Greenville, typical causes include:

* Flooding from the Mississippi River: Heavy rains can lead to river overflow, affecting homes near the banks.
* Heavy rainfall: Seasonal storms can lead to water pooling in yards and basements.
* Old plumbing systems: Many historic homes in Greenville may have aging pipes that can burst or leak.

For instance, the Thompson family experienced flooding when heavy rains combined with river runoff caused water to seep into their basement. Recognizing these risks can help homeowners better prepare.



## Steps to Take Immediately After Water Damage in Greenville

When water damage occurs, immediate action is crucial to minimize further damage. After a leak caused significant damage in the Ramirez household, they took the following steps:



* Shut off the electricity to avoid electrocution risks.
* Move furniture and valuables to higher ground to prevent loss.
* Document the damage with photographs for insurance claims.
* Contact our restoration team for professional assistance.

By following these steps, you can significantly reduce the impact of water damage and facilitate a smoother recovery process.

Given Greenville's humid climate, mold growth can quickly become an issue after water damage. The Robinson family discovered this after a plumbing leak. We provided them with effective mold prevention strategies, including:



* Dry out affected areas within 24-48 hours to prevent mold growth.
* Use dehumidifiers to reduce moisture levels in the home.
