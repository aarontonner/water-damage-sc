## How to Prevent Water Damage in Pass Christian

A few years ago one of our clients, Mrs. Thompson, had a big water leak during a hurricane. After we restored her home she asked us how she could prevent future water damage. We told her simple but effective steps: install a sump pump in her basement, keep gutters and downspouts clean and inspect the roof annually for leaks. She also invested in a water leak detection system which alerts homeowners to small leaks before they become big problems. Mrs. Thompson hasn’t had a major issue since. Take steps now and save yourself a headache later. Contact us today to learn more about preventing water damage.
